About
My research uses comparative methods to explore macroevolutionary patterns of behavior and cognition in humans and other animals. I am currently a PhD student with Oxford’s [Centre for the Study of Social Cohesion] (https://www.cssc.ox.ac.uk/home), researching warfare in past human societies through building historical and cross-cultural datasets. I am also involved with the [Diverse Intelligences project] (https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/0464) on the evolution of cephalopod cognition, helping to build a quantitative database of ecology, physiology, and behavior.

Before starting at Oxford I completed an MSc in Human Evolution and Behaviour at University College London (UCL) and a BA in Global Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. For my MSc research, I constructed a phylogeny of historical religious groups to examine cultural evolutionary patterns of afterlife beliefs. I also worked as a research assistant on the Seshat Global History Databank, researching and coding variables about the social structures and conflicts of past societies into a comparative database.
